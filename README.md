### [Q1) Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aly.eyad/viz/ArrivalsandDepartures_16648836361880/MostDelaysperState)

#### Summary

> This dashboard shows the airports with the highest average arrival and departure delays. It shows airports across the entire country by default, but it can be filtered by state using the map.
>> It concludes that **Guam International Airport** is the airport with the highest **arrival** delay. While **Sawyer International Airport** is the airport with the highest **departure** delay.

#### Design

> The map was added to make the visualization more interactive for viewers. Arrivals and Departures were seperated into two visualizations to make them clearer to understand separately.
> A tooltip is added to the visualization to provide extra information to it without complications, where hovering over a state displays the average arrival and departure delays for that state.

### [Q2) What causes delays?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aly.eyad/viz/FactorscausingDelays/FactorsCausingArrivalandDepartureDelays)

#### Summary

> This story attempts to explore some factors that may lead to arrival and departure delays. It includes line charts showing the trend in average delays across different days of the month, as well as different months of the year. It also includes bar charts showing the average delays per state.
>> The line chart shows that the highest delays occur in **June**, and decrease till they reach their lowest in **September**.
>> The bar chart shows that the state with the highest average delays is **Guam**. After removing Guam, the states with the highest arrival delay are: **American Samoa, Iowa and Arkansas**. While the states with the highest departure delays are: **New Jersey, Illinois, and Maryland**.

#### Design

> The lines on the line chart are blue and orange to provide contrast and clarity, and to be readable for people with color blindness. Only one legend is used to reduce data-to-ink ratio. In the bar chart, only one x-axis label is used at the bottom to avoid clutter.

### [Q3) What are the most common Airports?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aly.eyad/viz/MostCommonAirports/MostCommonAirports)

#### Summary

> This dashboard shows information about the airports most commonly used as an origin or a destination, as well as the most common combination of origin and destination using bar charts. This will help airlines choose the most popular and lucrative trips.
>> It concludes that the most common airports are **Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport**. The most common combination of origin-destination is **San Francisco International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport**.

#### Design

Bar charts were used in these visualizations due to the abundance of airports, which makes it difficult to view all of them, but a sorted bar chart makes it easier to see the top few bars, with the ability to scroll down if needed.
